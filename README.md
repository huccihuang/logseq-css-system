# The Logseq CSS System

## What is it?
The Logseq CSS System is a modular, block-based approach for changing the look and feel of [Logseq](https://logseq.com). It has been thoughtfully engineered to allow easy customization by the non-tech-affine end user and offers different minimal, beautiful designed elegant themes.

## How to install the themes
Install them from the Logseq marketplace or load them manually by adding somthing like

    @import url('https://rcvd.github.io/logseq-css-system/output/bear.css');
    
to your `custom.css`. Replace `bear.css` with `craft.css`, `quattro.css` or `things.css` if you want one of the other themes.
